## Next Steps Priority
1. **Implement User Authentication (OAuth 2.0)**
   - Essential for personalization and security
2. **Enhance Recommendation Algorithm with Interaction History and Advanced Filtering**
   - Incorporates user feedback, interaction data, and improved noise reduction
3. **Add Web Scraping for X/Twitter and Facebook**
   - Expands content sources without relying on paid APIs
4. **Improve Frontend UX/UI with Glove-on-Post Imagery and Mobile Responsiveness**
   - Enhances user engagement with thematic design and better accessibility
5. **Set Up Automated Testing**
   - Ensures code quality and prevents regressions

## Additional Notes
- **Research Integration:** New tasks enhance GlovePostâ€™s core concepts: aggregating diverse sources, filtering out noise, personalizing recommendations, and embedding the glove-on-post metaphor into the UI/UX.
- **Scraping Compliance:** Web scraping for X/Twitter and Facebook must comply with their terms of service and robots.txt files. Alternative open data sources (e.g., public RSS feeds) may be considered if needed.
- **User Empowerment:** Features like tweaking recommendation parameters and visualizing the recommendation process give users more control and transparency.
- **Thematic Design:** The glove-on-post metaphor is woven into the frontend tasks to create a unique and engaging user experience.
