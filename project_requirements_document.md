# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
**Project Name:** GlovePost  
**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** March 09, 2025  
**Prepared by:** Lawrence/Grok 3  
**Prepared for:** Development Team / LLM Coding Interface  

## 1. Overview
### 1.1 Purpose
GlovePost is a web platform that aggregates information from multiple sources (e.g., X, Facebook, 4chan, Reddit, media sites), strips away noise and advertisements, and presents curated, personalized content to users. Inspired by the altruistic winter tradition of hanging lost gloves on posts to make them visible above snow, GlovePost "raises" relevant information above the digital clutter, offering a clean, user-controlled experience enhanced by machine learning insights from Twitter's open-source "the-algorithm."

### 1.2 Objectives
- Aggregate content from X, Facebook, 4chan, Reddit, and media sites into a unified, ad-free feed.
- Provide a personalized recommendation system leveraging machine learning (inspired by Twitter's LightGBM approach) based on user interactions, content metadata, and preferences.
- Ensure transparency and user control over the recommendation algorithm with explainable outputs.
- Deliver a modular, scalable architecture for ease of development and future enhancements.

### 1.3 Scope
This PRD covers the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for GlovePost, including core features like content aggregation, a machine learning-enhanced recommendation engine, user personalization, and a basic UI. Future phases (out of scope) may include advanced analytics, community features beyond comments, or mobile apps.

## 2. Functional Requirements
### 2.1 System Overview
GlovePost will be a web-based application with a modular architecture, split into distinct components for manageable development. The system includes:

- **Content Aggregation Module:** Fetches and processes data from external sources.
- **Recommendation Engine Module:** Analyzes user behavior and curates content using a machine learning model.
- **User Interface Module:** Displays content and settings in a clean, intuitive layout.
- **User Profile Module:** Manages user preferences and data transparency.
- **Backend Services Module:** Handles API integrations, data storage, and processing.

### 2.2 Module Breakdown and Requirements
#### 2.2.1 Content Aggregation Module
**Purpose:** Fetch and clean content from external sources.

**Requirements:**
- **Data Sources:** Integrate with X (via scraping or API), Facebook (scraping), 4chan, Reddit, and at least 3 media site RSS feeds (e.g., BBC, CNN, The Guardian).
- **Content Fetching:** Retrieve posts/articles every 15 minutes (configurable interval).
- **Noise Filtering:** Remove ads, sponsored content, and low-quality posts (e.g., <50 words, excessive emojis).
- **Output:** Store cleaned content in a database with fields: `title`, `source`, `url`, `content_summary`, `timestamp`, `category`, `upvotes`, `downvotes`, `fetched_at`.
- **Modularity:** Independent script/service callable by other modules.

#### 2.2.2 Recommendation Engine Module
**Purpose:** Curate personalized content based on user behavior using insights from Twitter's "the-algorithm."

**Requirements:**
- **Input:** User interaction data (e.g., views, clicks, thumbs up/down), content metadata (e.g., category, source, age), user preferences.
- **Algorithm:** Implement a machine learning model (e.g., LightGBM) for engagement prediction, replacing the basic weighted scoring system (previously 50% topic match, 30% source preference, 20% recency).
  - Features: Content category, source, age, user preference weights, past interactions (views, ratings).
  - Two-stage process: Candidate generation (filter by category/source) followed by ranking with the model.
- **Output:** List of top 10 recommended articles per user, refreshed on login or every hour.
- **Transparency:** Provide explainable outputs (e.g., "Recommended due to 60% category match, 30% recent engagement, 10% source trust") using model feature importance.
- **Modularity:** Separate service with API endpoints (e.g., `/recommendations/user_id`), callable by the UI.

#### 2.2.3 User Interface Module
**Purpose:** Display curated content and user controls with a glove-on-post metaphor.

**Requirements:**
- **Homepage:**
  - Display "Featured Gloves" (top 3 recommendations) with title, summary, source, and reasoning (e.g., "Why this?").
  - List of categories (e.g., Tech, News) as "Posts" with article "Gloves" underneath.
- **Article View:** Full content with summary option, thumbs up/down buttons, and comment section.
- **Settings Page:**
  - Sliders for topic weights (e.g., Tech: 80%, News: 20%).
  - Source toggles (e.g., enable/disable X, Reddit).
  - Recommendation explanation toggle and interactive visualization (e.g., chart of feature influence).
- **Design:** Minimalistic, responsive, using glove/post imagery (e.g., SVG icons, animations for picking gloves).
- **Modularity:** Front-end framework (e.g., React) with reusable components.

#### 2.2.4 User Profile Module
**Purpose:** Manage user data and preferences.

**Requirements:**
- **User Data:** Store `user_id`, `email`, `browsing_history` (article IDs, timestamps, ratings), `preferences` (JSON object).
- **Privacy:** Opt-in tracking with clear consent popup on first login, GDPR-compliant data handling.
- **Customization:** API to update preferences (e.g., `POST /user/preferences`), including sliders for recommendation factors.
- **Modularity:** Independent database and service layer, accessible by UI and Recommendation Engine.

#### 2.2.5 Backend Services Module
**Purpose:** Coordinate modules, handle storage, and ensure scalability.

**Requirements:**
- **APIs:** RESTful endpoints (e.g., `/content/fetch`, `/user/recommendations`, `/interactions/log`).
- **Database:**
  - Relational (e.g., PostgreSQL) for user data and interactions.
  - NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB) for content storage.
- **Scalability:** Cloud hosting (e.g., AWS) with load balancing and batch processing for model training.
- **Modularity:** Microservices architecture, each module deployable independently.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements
