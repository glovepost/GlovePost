Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Project Name: GlovePost
Version: 1.0

Date: March 09, 2025

Prepared by: [Lawrence/Grok 3]

Prepared for: Development Team / LLM Coding Interface

1. Overview
1.1 Purpose
GlovePost is a web platform that aggregates information from multiple sources (e.g., X, Facebook, media sites), strips away noise and advertisements, and presents curated, personalized content to users. Inspired by the altruistic winter tradition of hanging lost gloves on posts to make them visible above snow, GlovePost "raises" relevant information above the digital clutter, offering a clean, user-controlled experience.

1.2 Objectives
Aggregate content from X, Facebook, and media sites into a unified, ad-free feed.
Provide a personalized recommendation system based on user browsing habits.
Ensure transparency and user control over the recommendation algorithm.
Deliver a modular, scalable architecture for ease of development and future enhancements.
1.3 Scope
This PRD covers the initial Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for GlovePost, including core features like content aggregation, user personalization, and a basic UI. Future phases (out of scope for this document) may include advanced analytics, community features, or mobile apps.

2. Functional Requirements
2.1 System Overview
GlovePost will be a web-based application with a modular architecture, split into distinct components for manageable development. The system includes:

Content Aggregation Module: Fetches and processes data from external sources.
Recommendation Engine Module: Analyzes user behavior and curates content.
User Interface Module: Displays content and settings in a clean, intuitive layout.
User Profile Module: Manages user preferences and data transparency.
Backend Services Module: Handles API integrations, data storage, and processing.
2.2 Module Breakdown and Requirements
2.2.1 Content Aggregation Module
Purpose: Fetch and clean content from external sources.

Requirements:

Data Sources: Integrate with X API, Facebook API, and at least 3 media site RSS feeds (e.g., BBC, CNN, The Guardian).
Content Fetching: Retrieve posts/articles every 15 minutes (configurable interval).
Noise Filtering: Remove ads, sponsored content, and low-quality posts (e.g., <50 words, excessive emojis).
Output: Store cleaned content in a database with fields: title, source, url, content_summary, timestamp, category.
Modularity: Independent script/service callable by other modules.
2.2.2 Recommendation Engine Module
Purpose: Curate personalized content based on user behavior.

Requirements:

Input: User browsing data (e.g., articles viewed, time spent, clicks).
Algorithm: Basic weighted scoring system (e.g., 50% topic match, 30% source preference, 20% recency).
Output: List of top 10 recommended articles per user, refreshed on login or every hour.
Transparency: Log recommendation reasoning (e.g., "Based on your interest in tech from X").
Modularity: Separate service with API endpoints (e.g., /recommendations/user_id).
2.2.3 User Interface Module
Purpose: Display curated content and user controls.

Requirements:

Homepage:
Display "Featured Gloves" (top 3 recommendations) with title, summary, and source.
List of categories (e.g., Tech, News, Science) as "Posts" with article "Gloves" underneath.
Article View: Full content with option to see summary or key points.
Settings Page:
sliders for topic weights (e.g., Tech: 80%, News: 20%).
Source toggle (e.g., enable/disable X).
Recommendation explanation toggle.
Design: Minimalistic, responsive, using glove/post imagery (e.g., CSS icons).
Modularity: Front-end framework (e.g., React) with reusable components.
2.2.4 User Profile Module
Purpose: Manage user data and preferences.

Requirements:

User Data: Store user_id, email, browsing_history (article IDs, timestamps), preferences (JSON object).
Privacy: Opt-in tracking with clear consent popup on first login.
Customization: API to update preferences (e.g., POST /user/preferences).
Modularity: Independent database and service layer, accessible by UI and Recommendation Engine.
2.2.5 Backend Services Module
Purpose: Coordinate modules, handle storage, and ensure scalability.

Requirements:

APIs: RESTful endpoints (e.g., /content/fetch, /user/recommendations).
Database:
Relational (e.g., PostgreSQL) for user data.
NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB) for content storage.
Scalability: Cloud hosting (e.g., AWS) with load balancing for high traffic.
Modularity: Microservices architecture, each module deployable independently.

3. Non-Functional Requirements
3.1 Performance
Page load time: <2 seconds for homepage with 10 articles.
Content refresh: Real-time updates reflected within 15 minutes of source posting.
Handle 1,000 concurrent users without performance degradation.
3.2 Security
Encrypt user data (e.g., HTTPS, AES-256 for database).
OAuth 2.0 for login (e.g., Google, X authentication).
Rate limit API calls to prevent abuse (e.g., 100 requests/minute per IP).
3.3 Usability
Intuitive navigation with <3 clicks to any feature.
Accessible design (WCAG 2.1 compliance, e.g., alt text for glove icons).
Mobile-responsive layout.
3.4 Maintainability
Modular code with clear documentation for each component.
Unit tests covering 80% of critical functions (e.g., content fetching, recommendations).

4. Technical Specifications
4.1 Tech Stack
Front-End: React.js (UI components), CSS (styling with glove/post theme).
Back-End: Node.js (API server), Python (content processing, recommendation logic).
Database: PostgreSQL (users), MongoDB (content).
Infrastructure: AWS (EC2 for compute, S3 for static assets).
APIs: X API, Facebook Graph API, RSS parsers.
4.2 Module Coding Segments
Each module should be a standalone chunk, coded in sequence:

Content Aggregation Module
File: content_aggregator.js
Tasks: API calls, content cleaning, database insertion.
Est. Effort: 20 hours.
Backend Services Module
File: server.js
Tasks: REST API setup, database connections.
Est. Effort: 15 hours.
User Profile Module
File: user_profile.js
Tasks: User CRUD operations, preference management.
Est. Effort: 10 hours.
Recommendation Engine Module
File: recommendation_engine.py
Tasks: Scoring algorithm, API integration.

User Interface Module
Files: Home.js, Settings.js, Article.js
Tasks: Component design, API consumption.
Est. Effort: 30 hours.

5. User Stories
As a user, I want to see a curated list of articles on my homepage, so I can quickly find relevant information without searching.
Acceptance: Homepage loads with 10 articles, no ads visible.
As a user, I want to adjust my topic preferences, so I can control what content I see.
Acceptance: Settings page allows slider adjustments, updates reflected in feed.
As a user, I want to understand why articles are recommended, so I trust the system.
Acceptance: Each article shows a brief "Why this?" explanation.
As a developer, I want modular code, so I can update one feature without affecting others.
Acceptance: Each module runs independently, passes unit tests.

6. Assumptions and Constraints
6.1 Assumptions
API access to X and Facebook is available and affordable.
Users are comfortable with basic customization (sliders, toggles).
Initial focus is web-only, not mobile apps.
6.2 Constraints
No real-time content fetching beyond 15-minute intervals due to API limits.
Limited to English-language content for MVP.

7. Milestones
